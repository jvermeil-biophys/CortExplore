22-03-22_M1_P1_C1,none,none,no,Cell looks a bit unhealthy
22-03-22_M2_P1_C2,dynamic,blebby,yes,Many many many beads!!
22-03-22_M2_P1_C3,nan,,yes,cell ate bead
22-03-22_M2_P1_C4,nan,,yes,cell ate bead

22-05-09_M3_P2_C5,none,polarised rear,no,its beautiful
22-05-09_M3_P2_C3,none,polarised rear,no,
22-05-09_M3_P1_C3,dynamic,polarised rear,no,Breaks into blebs and then forms beautiful lamellipodia
22-06-09_M1_P1_C1,dynamic,polarised rear,yes,"Seems like it was blebbing from before, probably because it was globally activated previously"
22-06-09_M1_P1_C2,none,polarised rear,no,funny looking with a stable protrusion on one side (maybe lamellipodia)
22-06-09_M1_P1_C4,none,oscillating,yes,
22-06-09_M1_P1_C5,dynamic,none,yes,"many beads, a bit messy - exclude!"
22-06-09_M1_P1_C6,none,polarised rear,no,
22-06-09_M1_P1_C7,none,polarised rear,no,Other neighbouring bead affecting some bead movement maybe

22-06-09_M2_P1_C8,none,none,no,Cell is super good but the lamellipodia seem to affect the bead movements
